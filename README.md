- Hi, Iâ€™m @ZachShubert

- I work as a electrical design engineer, and consider my self a creator. Much of my code on here is from personal projects, 
which can span a large range of differet disciples, as my attention span is not long enough to last past the current project.
- I am interested in Audio DSP and microcontrollers
